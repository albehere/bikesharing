## Summary

This analysis could be used to compare target market demographics between New York and the proposed city. It could also be used to guide the positioning of bikes in the proposed city. In addition, the results show that in general more males users ride for longer. This could be used in marketing strategies. This analysis is limited to comparision by gender primarily. More data could be gathered on the users of the NYC system such as reasons for trips and location data. With more data it can help explain why the system is being used.
